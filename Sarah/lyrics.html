<h1> Blue Monday </h1>
<h4> By: New Order </h4>

<div>
How does it feel <br>
To treat me like you do? <br>
When you've laid your hands upon me <br>
And told me who you are? <br>
Thought I was mistaken<br>
I thought I heard your words<br>
Tell me, how do I feel?<br>
Tell me now, how do I feel?<br>
</div>

<P>
<div>Those who came before me</div>
<div>Lived through their vocations</div>
<div>From the past until completion</div>
<div>They'll turn away no more</div>
<div>And I still find it so hard</div>
<div>To say what I need to say</div>
<div>But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me</div>
<div>Just how I should feel today</div>
</p>

<div>
I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
</div>

<div>
Now I stand here waiting
</div>

<div>
I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me, how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?
</div>
